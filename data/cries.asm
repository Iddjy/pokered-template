CryData:
	;$BaseCry, $Pitch, $Length
	; the higher the value for $Pitch, the higher pitched the cry
	; the higher the value for $Length, the longer the cry
	; cry ids $0FF and $100 are not usable since cry ids are not actually handled as 2 bytes,
	; but as 2 pages with 1 byte ids, hence ids 00 and FF are both unusable in each page
